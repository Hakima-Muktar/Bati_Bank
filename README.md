## Project Overview 
Bati Bank, a major financial service provider with over 10 years of experience, is partnering with a fast-growing eCommerce company to launch a Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) service.To support this service, the bank needs a Credit Scoring Model.
# Credit scoring 
is the process of using statistical and machine learning techniques to estimate how likely a customer is to default (fail to repay). 
Banks traditionally build these models by analyzing past borrowers’ data and loan performance.
# Project Structure
Mandate a standardized project structure from the beginning.

## Credit Risk Analysis and Modeling
 # Credit Risk
 Credit risk is the possibility that a borrower will fail to repay a loan, causing a financial loss to the lender. It affects loan decisions, interest rates, and the overall stability and profitability of financial institutions.
 # Credit risk modeling 
 applies statistical and machine-learning methods to measure the likelihood that a borrower will default. It enhances lending decisions by improving risk assessment, optimizing portfolios, and enabling efficient capital allocation.
 ## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 EDA is a critical initial step to understand data, identify patterns, uncover quality issues, and guide feature engineering.
 # Key Steps in EDA:
 Structure of the Data: row, column and datatype
 Summary Statistics: mean median,std
 Distribution of Numerical Features
 Distribution of Categorical Features
 Correlation Analysis
 Identifying Missing Values
 Outlier Detection
 # Credit Risk Model Development Workflow
 Objectives & Requirements:
 Data Preparation:Collection, Cleaning and Feature Engineering
 Model Development: Data Splitting , choose models ,Train the Models,Hyperparameter Tuning and Cross-Validation
 Model Evaluation: Accuracy,Precision ,Recall (Sensitivity), F1 Score and ROC-AUC
# Deployment and Monitoring:
Integrate Model into Production
Monitor Model Performance and Drift
Plan for Periodic Recalibration
