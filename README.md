# Credit Risk Probability Model for Alternative Data
# 🚀 Project Overview
This project is developed for Bati Bank in collaboration with a leading eCommerce company to enable a Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) service. The core business objective is to build a robust credit scoring model that estimates the likelihood of customer default using alternative behavioral data from the eCommerce platform.

Given the absence of traditional credit history, we leverage transactional patterns, such as Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) data, to engineer features and train a predictive model. This model will # ultimately assign a risk probability score, a credit score, and guide loan amount and term decisions.

# Credit Scoring Business Understanding
# 1. Basel II and the Need for Interpretability
The Basel II Accord emphasizes accurate and transparent measurement of credit risk. In line with this, our credit scoring model must be interpretable and well-documented to support: Regulatory review Auditability Internal governance An interpretable model builds trust with stakeholders and ensures alignment with capital adequacy requirements.

# 2. Importance of a Proxy Variable
Since our dataset lacks an explicit "default" label, we must construct a proxy variable (e.g., based on abnormal transaction behavior, inactivity, or refund frequency) to simulate loan default behavior.

⚠️ Risks of using a proxy:

<<<<<<< HEAD
False assumptions: The proxy may not capture true default intent. Bias propagation: Any proxy bias will be inherited by the model. Business impact: Could lead to misclassifying customers, affecting profits or reputational trust.
# 3. Simple vs. Complex Models in Regulated Environments
Criteria Logistic Regression (WoE) Gradient Boosting (GBM) Interpretability High Low Regulatory acceptance Preferred Requires explanation (SHAP/LIME) Performance Moderate High Deployment complexity Low Medium to High Choosing the right model depends on balancing performance vs. interpretability, especially in highly regulated financial environments.

 ## ✅ Task 1 – Credit Scoring Business Understanding
Basel II principles researched and applied
Proxy risk logic outlined
Trade-offs between model types discussed
## ✅ Task 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Numerical/categorical distributions visualized using subplots
Missing values and outliers identified and quantified
Correlation matrix plotted for numerical fields
🧠 Task 3 – Feature Engineering & Proxy Target Creation Constructed Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) features using transaction history.

Engineered behavioral features such as:

days_since_last_transaction

total_transaction_count

average_transaction_amount

transaction_volume_per_channel

Handled high-cardinality categorical features with frequency or target encoding.

✅ Proxy Target Variable Since explicit default labels were missing:

Constructed a proxy target based on:

Inactivity after high RFM scores

Abnormal transaction refund patterns

Validated proxy label distribution and balanced the dataset using undersampling.

✅ Ready to use engineered features and proxy variable for model training.

🤖 Task 4 – Model Training, Evaluation, and Tracking Trained multiple supervised classifiers:

Logistic Regression (baseline)

Random Forest (tuned via RandomizedSearchCV)

✅ Evaluation Metrics Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score

ROC AUC used for model selection

📈 Best Model Selection Random Forest selected based on highest ROC AUC

Hyperparameters and performance logged using MLflow

🔬 Model Registry Best model registered under:

yaml Copy Edit Model Name: FraudDetectionModel Stage: Staging ✅ Model saved both locally and in the MLflow Registry.

🧪 Task 5 – Model Interpretability In line with Basel II interpretability requirements:

Interpreted model predictions using SHAP

Identified key features driving default predictions (e.g., low frequency, high recency)

Plotted SHAP summary and force plots to visualize:

Global feature importance

Per-customer risk explanations

✅ Interpretability analysis helps build stakeholder trust and regulatory compliance.

🌐 Task 6 – Model Deployment and Continuous Integration ✅ FastAPI Deployment Developed REST API using FastAPI in src/api/main.py

Exposed /predict endpoint to return customer risk probability

Validated requests and responses with Pydantic models

📦 Dockerized Service Dockerfile and docker-compose setup:

Runs the FastAPI app via uvicorn

Exposes the service on localhost:8000

bash Copy Edit docker-compose up --build ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions Configured GitHub Actions workflow in .github/workflows/ci.yml

Workflow includes:

flake8 linter to check code style

pytest to run unit tests

Fails build on any style/test erro
